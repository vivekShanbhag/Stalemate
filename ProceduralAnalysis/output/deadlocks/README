In this directory we share a program that can deadlock the JVM. 
This bug has since been fixed in Java 1.7. Earlier versions of Java1.6 deadlock.

In another directory herein:  there are 4 more programs that all use the MIDI
API to deadlock the JVM as our analysis predicts. In that subdirectory there
is a README file that elaborates about those programs and deadlocks.
 
Source Files:	KTest2.java
Class Files:	KTest2$1.class KTest2.class
Deadlocked JVM:	KTest2.stack
Bug Id:		7118809
Command:	jdb KTest2
Additional actions (if any):	As evidenced in KTest2.stack

Our icse-poster-2014 submission: For brevity in the paper, we have
refered to KTest2.java by the name "RcCt" that stands for the names
of the two types of objects involved in this deadlock:
sun.security.krb5.internal.rcache.ReplayCache and
sun.security.krb5.internal.rcache.CacheTable
