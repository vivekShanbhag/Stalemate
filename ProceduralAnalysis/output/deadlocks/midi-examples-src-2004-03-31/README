A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM :
The midi-examples-src-2004-03-31 zip file available from www.jsresources.org is
meant to demonstrate how to use various Sound-API classes offered in the
Java-library. A file (MidiPlayer.java) from that is modified, as per the
code below, to call it RealTimeSequencerTest[234]?.java, and compiled, and
executed as per instructions below to deadlock its hosting JVM.


unzip the midi-examples-src-2004-03-31 

In the src directory 2 files are changed from the original:
	RealTimeSequencerTest.java
	MidiPlayer.java

4 New files are added (all minor varients of MidiPlayer.java):
	RealTimeSequencerTest.java
	RealTimeSequencerTest2.java
	RealTimeSequencerTest3.java
	RealTimeSequencerTest4.java

barkwall.mid, take5.mid, used as data-file for input
	is downloaded from http://users0.ee.net/lstone/midi.htm 

There are a few stack-dump files that are produced from a deadlocked JVM:
	deadlock.stack	: jdb -classpath ..:. RealTimeSequencerTest\
			      -S "Real Time Sequencer"  ../take5.mid
	deadlock2.stack	: jdb -classpath ..:. RealTimeSequencerTest2\
			      -S "Real Time Sequencer" ../take5.mid
	deadlock3.stack	: javac RealTimeSequencerTest3.java DumpReceiver.java\
			      MidiCommon.java ../gnu/getopt/Getopt.java\
			      ../gnu/getopt/LongOpt.java;\
			      jdb -classpath ..:. RealTimeSequencerTest3\
			      -S "Real Time Sequencer" ../barkwall.mid
	deadlock4.1.stack: jdb -classpath ..:. RealTimeSequencerTest4\
			      -S "Real Time Sequencer" ../../barkwall.mid
	deadlock4.2.stack: jdb -classpath ..:. RealTimeSequencerTest4\
			      -S "Real Time Sequencer" ../../barkwall.mid
	deadlock4.3.stack: jdb -classpath ..:. RealTimeSequencerTest4\
			      -S "Real Time Sequencer" ../../barkwall.mid
