Our icse-poster-2014 submission: For brevity in the paper, we have
refered to CorbaDeadlock.java by the name "TcPdh" that stands for
the names of the two types involved in this deadlock:
org.omg.CORBA.TypeCode and com.sun.org.omg.CORBA.ParameterDescriptionHelper 

Similarly, we have refered to CorbaEDeadlock.java by the name "TcEdh" that
stands for the names of the two types involved in this deadlock:
org.omg.CORBA.TypeCode and com.sun.org.omg.CORBA.ExceptionDescriptionHelper
